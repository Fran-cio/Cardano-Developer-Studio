### Introduction

A Development Container, or DevContainer, is a fully configured and isolated development environment running inside a Docker container. The concept leverages Docker to create a consistent, portable, and reproducible environment for developing software. This means that all the necessary tools, extensions, and dependencies required for your project are bundled and run inside the container. By doing so, it eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem, as every developer working on the project uses an identical development environment, regardless of the host operating system or local configurations.

DevContainers are defined by a set of configuration files within a project, typically stored in a `.devcontainer` directory. This configuration includes a `devcontainer.json` file, which specifies how the development environment should be set up (e.g., which Docker image to use, which VS Code extensions to install automatically), and often a Dockerfile that defines the container image itself.

To use a development container, you need:

- Visual Studio Code: The popular source-code editor by Microsoft, available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Docker: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers.
- Remote - Containers extension for VS Code: An extension by Microsoft that integrates VS Code with Docker, enabling you to use or create DevContainers.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Visual Studio Code installed.
Install the "Remote - Containers" extension from Microsoft. This extension allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of VS Code's full feature set.

### Open Your Project in VS Code

Start Visual Studio Code.
Open your project folder that contains the `.devcontainer` directory by going to File > Open Folder... and selecting your project folder.

### Start the Development Container

With your project opened in VS Code, you'll see a pop-up in the bottom right corner asking if you want to reopen the project in a container. Click "Reopen in Container". If you miss the popup, you can also open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`.
VS Code will start building the development container based on the configuration found in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and the Dockerfile. This process can take a few minutes the first time as it downloads the necessary Docker images and builds your container.

### Work Inside the Container

Once the container is running, VS Code will attach to it automatically. Your VS Code interface will look and feel the same, but you'll be working inside the container now. You can install extensions, edit files, debug, and run commands just as you would on your local machine.
Any changes you make will be reflected inside the container. Files modified in your project folder will also be updated on your host machine, thanks to the volume mount defined in your container configuration.

### Stop the Development Container

When you're done working, you can stop the development container by closing VS Code or by using the Command Palette to run "Remote-Containers: Close Remote Connection".
Your container will stop, and VS Code will return to being a local editor. Your work will remain saved in your project folder.

### Next Steps

To start working in the container again, simply reopen your project in VS Code and repeat the steps to reopen your project in the container.

## Initial Requirements Checks by the Script

The main script starts by performing several checks to ensure the environment meets all necessary requirements for successful execution. These checks include verifying the presence of a package manager, installing required commands, and confirming that the versions of Bash, Docker, and Docker Compose are sufficient.

### What the Script Checks

1. Package Manager: The script checks if a recognized package manager is available on the system. This is crucial for installing other required packages.
   
2. Required Commands: The script automatically installs the following essential commands if they are not already present:
- jq
- lz4
- curl
- grep
- sed
- gawk
- cut

3. Software Versions: The script verifies that the installed versions of Bash, Docker, and Docker Compose meet the minimum requirements:
- Bash version 4.0 or newer
- Docker version 19.03 or newer
- Docker Compose version 1.25 or newer
