To interact with the Cardano Wallet container, follow the same steps as mentioned for the Cardano Node container to open a shell within the container using VS Code.

Inside the container, you can perform actions like generating a recovery phrase:

```
cardano-wallet recovery-phrase generate --size 15
```

To create a wallet using the generated recovery phrase, you can use cURL or Postman to make an API request:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/v2/wallets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "name": "Your Wallet Name",
        "mnemonic_sentence": ["salute", "ritual", "length", "dress", "seminar", "adult", "hybrid", "travel", "ridge", "satisfy", "style", "vocal", "permit", "foster", "pizza"],
        "passphrase": "your-secure-passphrase"
      }'
```

http://localhost:8090/v2/wallets


### Cardano DB Sync

Refer to the documentation for more details:

[Cardano DB Sync Documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/cardano-components/cardano-db-sync/about-db-sync/)

[Cardano DB Sync GitHub](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync)

**Basic SQL queries to run against the synced database:**

- Sync progress of db-sync:
  
```
select
   100 * (extract (epoch from (max (time) at time zone 'UTC')) - extract (epoch from (min (time) at time zone 'UTC')))
      / (extract (epoch from (now () at time zone 'UTC')) - extract (epoch from (min (time) at time zone 'UTC')))
  as sync_percent
  from block ;
```

- Retrieving most recent block:

```
SELECT * FROM block ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 1;
```

- Slot number of the most recent block:

```
select slot_no from block where block_no is not null
    order by block_no desc limit 1 ;
```

- Current total on-chain supply of Ada (queryTotalSupply):

This just queries the UTxO set for unspent transaction outputs. It does not include staking rewards that have have not yet been withdrawn. Before being withdrawn rewards exist in ledger state and not on-chain.

Note: 1 ADA == 1,000,000 Lovelace

```
select sum (value) / 1000000 as current_supply from tx_out as tx_outer where
    not exists
      ( select tx_out.id from tx_out inner join tx_in
          on tx_out.tx_id = tx_in.tx_out_id and tx_out.index = tx_in.tx_out_index
          where tx_outer.id = tx_out.id
      ) ;

```

- Retrieving transactions in a block:

```
SELECT * FROM tx WHERE block_id = (SELECT id FROM block WHERE block_no = <block_number>);
```

Replace <block_number> with the actual block number you want to query transactions for. This query retrieves all the transactions associated with a specific block.

- Retrieving transaction details:
  
```
SELECT * FROM tx WHERE hash = '<transaction_hash>';
```

Replace <transaction_hash> with the actual transaction hash you want to retrieve details for. This query returns the details of a specific transaction.

- Querying UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output) information:

```
SELECT * FROM utxo WHERE tx_id = (SELECT id FROM tx WHERE hash = '<transaction_hash>');
```

Replace <transaction_hash> with the actual transaction hash you want to query UTxOs for. This query retrieves the UTxOs associated with a specific transaction.

- Retrieving address balance:

```
SELECT SUM(value) AS balance FROM utxo WHERE address = '<address>';
```

Replace <address> with the actual Cardano address you want to retrieve the balance for. This query calculates the total balance of an address by summing the values of its UTxOs.

- Querying stake distribution:

This query retrieves the total stake for each stake pool.

```
select pool_id, sum (amount) from epoch_stake group by pool_id ;
```
